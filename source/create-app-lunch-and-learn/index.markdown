HTML5 is all the rage these days.  I know you've all probably seen presentations and read articles.
This is going to be a little different.  Today we are going to make an HTML5 app using
a lot of the same technologies Netflix, Hulu and other internet video providers use to create
cross browser / cross platform apps.

## What Technologies Will We Be Using

 * [node.js - a JavaScript server](http://nodejs.org/)

 {% imgcap /images/nodejs-light.png node.js %}

 * [express - a node.js module web server](http://expressjs.com/) . . . *no IIS or Apache here!*

 * [Twitter Bootstrap - A clean responsive design layout framework](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/)

## What You Need

 * A laptop - PC or Mac, I haven't prepaired anything for Linux or any other *nix OS
 * An internt connection
 * At least a slight curiousity / interest in the subject

## What You Don't Need

 * Web development knowledge of any kind
