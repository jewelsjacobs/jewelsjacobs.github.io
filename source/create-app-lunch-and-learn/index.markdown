HTML5 is all the rage these days.
I know you've all probably seen presentations and read articles.
This is going to be a little different.  Today we are going to make an HTML5 app using
a lot of the same technologies Netflix, Hulu and other internet video providers use to create
cross browser / cross platform apps.

## What Technologies Will We Be Using

## What You Need

 * A laptop - The directions are pretty specific to the Windows 7 OS
  but if you know your way around your OS, it should be pretty easy to follow.
  All of the applications you need to install are available for Mac OS X or *nix as well.
 * An internt connection
 * An email account - you can get a free [Gmail](http://mail.google.com) or [Yahoo](http://mail.yahoo.com) one.
 * At least a slight curiousity / interest in the subject
 * Ability to copy, paste and type

## What You Don't Need

 * Web development knowledge of any kind
 * A mastery of web development buzzwords - I will explain terms like responsive design

## What You'll Get

 * A cool freely hosted website with embedded video you can view on any device and mess with at any time.
 It'll look exactly like [this](http://lit-ocean-2531.herokuapp.com/).
