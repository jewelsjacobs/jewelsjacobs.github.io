HTML5 is all the rage these days.  I know you've all probably seen presentations and read articles.
This is going to be a little different.  Today we are going to make an HTML5 app using
a lot of the same technologies Netflix, Hulu and other internet video providers use to create
cross browser / cross platform apps.

## What Technologies Will We Be Using

 * [node.js - a JavaScript server](http://nodejs.org/)

 {% imgcap /images/nodejs-light.png node.js %}

 * [express - a node.js module web server](http://expressjs.com/) . . . *no IIS or Apache here!*

 * [Twitter Bootstrap - A clean responsive design layout framework](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/)

 * [jade - html node templating engine](http://jade-lang.com/)

## What You Need

 * A laptop - The directions are pretty specific to the Windows 7 OS
  but if you know your way around your OS, it should be pretty easy to follow.
  All of the applications you need to install are available for Mac OS X or *nix as well.
 * An internt connection
 * An email account - you can get a free [Gmail](http://mail.google.com) or [Yahoo](http://mail.yahoo.com) one.
 * At least a slight curiousity / interest in the subject
 * Ability to copy, paste and type

## What You Don't Need

 * Web development knowledge of any kind
 * A mastery of web development buzzwords - I will explain terms like responsive design

## What You'll Get

 * A cool freely hosted website with embedded video you can view on any device and mess with at any time.
 It'll look exactly like [this](http://lit-ocean-2531.herokuapp.com/).
 * Lots of resources to further your knowledge
 * A beaming sense of accomplishment and well being

## Preparing For The Course

 * You'll save time by downloading and installing all of the required applications before
 the class.  View the [Downloading And Installing Stuff](http://html5devgal.com/getting-started/#downloading-and-installing-stuff)
 section.
