I had one of those 'Boy this would make an awesome jquery plugin' moments so I decided to roll my own.

  <!-- more -->

I also decided I needed to do it right so I could contribute it to the open source community without shame. 

I did some some google-ing to find some best practices info and ran into this awesome <a href="http://markdalgleish.com/2013/01/testing-jquery-plugins-cross-version-with-grunt/">article</a>. 

I thought I would pass it along.

Along with some other great <a href="http://learn.jquery.com/plugins/?rdfrom=http%3A%2F%2Fdocs.jquery.com%2Fmw%2Findex.php%3Ftitle%3DPlugins%2FAuthoring%26redirect%3Dno">articles</a> about jquery plugin best practices I was able to dive right in. 

<a href="https://github.com/jewelsjacobs/jquery.simpleCenter">Here's</a> what I've got so far (a work in progress).

If your new to testing, CI, plugin development or just want to see a good way to design good open source JavaScript apps, I highly recommend reading this stuff.
