When working with JavaScript, CSS and / or HTML we devs love browser development tools.
It's a little known fact, however that the console in these tools have thier own handy functions.

For example, if you want to copy an array or an object in the console, you can type

{% codeblock lang:javascript %}copy(someArrayVariableName){% endcodeblock %}

 Â Please note in this example I copied the contents of the clipboard to the console so you can see it.:
