<h3>In the "2D" world, you can inspect an element in a browser using the browser's development tool (Firebug in Firefox, Chrome IE and Safari have their own) and view / tweak the css in realtime to move the element around.</h3>
<h3>In the CSS3D world this is *not* so easy.</h3>
The <a title="three.js library" href="http://threejs.org/" target="_blank">three.js library</a> is great in that it allows you to create objects, cameras, lights, etc. and position / animate them (animating three.js objects can be achieved with <a title="tween.js" href="https://raw.github.com/mrdoob/three.js/master/examples/js/libs/tween.min.js" target="_blank">tween.js</a>) with x, y, and z coordinates.
<h3>3D positioning</h3>
Basically a 3D grid has an <strong>x plane</strong> (which is horizontal), a <strong>y plane</strong> (which is vertical) and a <strong>z plane</strong> (which is depth)

An object with coordinates x=0, y=0 and z=0 is smack in the <strong>middle</strong> of this grid
<ul>
	<li>A negative coordinate on the x plane will move an element left, positive to the right</li>
	<li>A negative coordinate on the y plane will move an element down, positive will move it up</li>
	<li>A negative coordinate on the z plane will move an element back, positive will move it forward</li>
</ul>

three.js has a <a title="CSS3D renderer" href="https://raw.github.com/mrdoob/three.js/master/examples/js/renderers/CSS3DRenderer.js" target="_blank">CSS3D renderer</a> which, magically using some very heavy matrix equations, dynamically translates x, y and z coordinates into a css property called -webkit-transform whose values usually look like this monstrosity:

[code language="text" gutter="false"]
-webkit-transform:
   translate3d(0px, 0px, 473.7224230277783px)
   matrix3d(
      0.9999499917030334, 0, -0.009999499656260014, 0,
      0, -1, 0, 0,
      0.009999499656260014, 0, 0.9999499917030334, 0,
      0.000002216018401668407, 0, -4987.5380859375, 1
   )
   translate3d(747.5px, 363.5px, 0px);
[/code]

<em>Yick.</em>

For more somewhat understandable info on matrix3d, <a title="matrix3D" href="http://9elements.com/html5demos/matrix3d/" target="_blank">this</a> is probably the best documentation out there.

So how are you supposed to figure out the position of a camera in real time after you've zoomed into your app?

Say you want an event to fire off when the camera is close to a certain object? Or an event to fire off only if you click on objects located in a certain z-plane coordinate?
<h3>Tracking Objects</h3>
Say you've got an object element with the following css:

[code language="text" gutter="false" highlight="7"]
-webkit-transform:
 translate3d(-50%, -50%, 0px)
 matrix3d(
 1, 0, 0, 0,
 0, -1, 0, 0,
 0, 0, 1, 0,
 -800, 800, 3500, 1
 );
[/code]

<strong><em>All you really care about as far as tracking the x, y and z coordinates of the object's element is the 13th, 14th and 15th values: -800, 800, 3500.</em></strong>

Here's an image to illustrate this object element:

[caption id="attachment_7" align="alignnone" width="700"]<a href="http://html5devgal.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/att-html5-u-verse-poc.png"><img class="size-large wp-image-7" alt="videoGrid" src="http://html5devgal.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/att-html5-u-verse-poc.png?w=700" width="700" height="428" /></a> Video Grid[/caption]

So by viewing these coordinates we know where the object is!

This comes in <strong>VERY </strong>handy when tracking the camera position during navigation.

<strong>UPDATE</strong>
I just was honored with a tweet from the great Ricardo Cabello Miguel aka <a title="mr.doob" href="http://www.mrdoob.com/" target="_blank">mr.doob</a>, creator of three.js, about a better way to get the cameras position in relationship to an object:
{% tweet https://twitter.com/mrdoob/status/327555248531050497 align='right' width='350' %}
Unfortunately, I can't really use this for realtime results during navigation because my camera and object position code is in global variables in a different files order to make things more modular. Setting breakpoints in the browser or entering it in the console isn't quote working for me. To just get the camera z-plane value in the browser console check out <a title="Trick to get three.js camera z plane value in browser development toolsÂ console" href="http://html5devgal.wordpress.com/2013/05/01/trick-to-get-three-js-camera-z-plane-value-in-browser-development-tools-console/" target="_blank">this</a> tip:
<h3>Tracking The Camera</h3>
The camera position can be found in the second child of whatever element is defined as the 'container' of the scene.

In this example this element has an id of 'video_container'.

Here's the JavaScript code to illustrate adding a scene to an element container:

[code language="javascript" highlight="14"]
var camera, scene, renderer, controls;

camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(75, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 0.1, 5000);
// camera is center &amp; 'front' or screen - camera coordinates are opposite to object coordinates
camera.position.z = 5000; // lower the number 'closer' to objects
camera.position.x = -25; // lower the number more to the right
camera.position.y = 0; // lower the number the more up
scene = new THREE.Scene();
// CSS3D renderer
renderer = new THREE.CSS3DRenderer();
renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);
renderer.domElement.style.position = 'absolute';

document.getElementById('video_container').appendChild(renderer.domElement);
[/code]

Here's the element in the markup, shown in Chrome's Developer Tools:

[caption id="attachment_8" align="alignnone" width="700"]<a href="http://html5devgal.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/cameraobject.png"><img class="size-large wp-image-8" alt="cameraobject" src="http://html5devgal.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/cameraobject.png?w=700" width="700" height="554" /></a> Camera Object Element[/caption]

Here's the CSS matrix3D values:

[code language="text" gutter="false" highlight="8"]
-webkit-transform:
   translate3d(0px, 0px, 445.70307751169236px)
   matrix3d(
      0.9999875426292419, 0, -0.004999937489628792,
      0, 0, -1,
      0, 0, 0.004999937489628792,
      0, 0.9999875426292419, 0,
      0, 0, -5000.0625, 1
   )
   translate3d(747.5px, 342px, 0px);
[/code]

As you can see the camera coordinates in the JavaScript code shows z = 5000, but in the css z = -5000.0625, a <strong>NEGATIVE</strong> value.

What gives?

Because the camera is 'facing' <em><strong>toward</strong></em> the grid and the objects in the grid, the negative and positive values of the x, y, and z coordinates are OPPOSITE of the actual grid and objects. So the way it works in the three.js library is:
<ul>
	<li>+x moves the camera to the LEFT of the grid whereas -z moves the camera to the RIGHT</li>
	<li>+y moves the camera DOWN in the grid whereas -z moves the camera UP</li>
	<li>+z moves the camera AWAY from the grid whereas -z moves the camera CLOSER</li>
</ul>
<strong>AN IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT TRACKBALL / TOUCH CONTROLS AND THE CAMERA Z POSITION:</strong>
To facilitate scroll wheel, trackball and touch zoom controls, a three.js utility library called <a title="TrackballControls.js" href="https://raw.github.com/mrdoob/three.js/master/examples/js/controls/TrackballControls.js" target="_blank">Trackball Controls</a> can be used.
Make sure all of your objects have <strong>POSITIVE</strong> z coordinate values. If they don't the camera will never reach them as it can only zoom up to z coordinate = 0. Once the camera has z = 0 you will keep pinching / scrolling forever and go no where.
