When working with JavaScript, CSS and / or HTML we devs love browser development tools.
It's a little known fact, however that the console in these tools have thier own handy functions.

  <!-- more -->

For example, if you want to copy an array or an object in the console, you can type

{% coderay lang:javascript %}copy(someArrayVariableName){% endcoderay %}

 Â Please note in this example I copied the contents of the clipboard to the console so you can see it.:

  {% imgcap /images/copyfromconsole.png Copying array in console to clipboard in Chrome %}

There's a whole bunch of other cool console functions as well. Check them out!
