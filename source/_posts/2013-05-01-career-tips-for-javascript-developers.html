  {% imgcap http://s3.amazonaws.com/rapgenius/1291131680_two-thumbs-up.jpg I am very much success in my jobs! %}
Here's some tips that will benefit ANY JavaScript developer on their path to success:

  <ul>
	<li>Tip #1 : In a JavaScript interview don't say 'Vanilla JavaScript? What framework is that?'.</li>
<li>Tip #2 : No motivation to learn that new tech? Go on lots of interviews for jobs you can't do.
    Can't forget those wrong answers! </li>
<li>Tip #3 : Don't do phone interviews while going to the bathroom. No matter how nervous you are.
    That goes for Skype too.</li>
    </ul>
